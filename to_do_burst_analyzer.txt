To-Fix:
- double check all the calculations, e.g. fluence, energy, etc
- convert the toas to barycentric?
- better normalization (normalise vs normalize in basic funcs)

- add dedisperse function (allow user to input a new DM value?)
- improve acf/gaussian fitting initial parameters (bounds help but slows down code a lot)
    - test separate 1d fits instead of 2d

- preview and flag stage: remove ax_space and ax_right ticks/labels



Done: (test/check and remove from list)
- add a check so that the dynamic spectrum is the correct shape to downsample
- flag stage: zapping close to the window edges after jess doesnt work\
- Created DataFrame with csv output for burst properties
- compute stage: the event duration lines dont update with tsamp changes
