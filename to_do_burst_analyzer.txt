To-Fix:
- double check all the calculations, e.g. fluence, energy, etc
- convert the toas to barycentric?
- better normalization (normalise vs normalize in basic funcs)
- preview and flag stage: remove ax_space and ax_right ticks/labels
- burst properties in pandas df should be from acf
- peaks dont update with change in time resolution (clicking adds a line at wrong position)
- if gaussian fits dont work, button to flag bad fit (in this case use manually selected event dur/ specex)

Done: (test/check and remove from list)
- add a check so that the dynamic spectrum is the correct shape to downsample
- flag stage: zapping close to the window edges after jess doesnt work\
- Created DataFrame with csv output for burst properties
- compute stage: the event duration lines dont update with tsamp changes
- added adjustable DM via textbox in stage 1
- improve acf/gaussian fitting initial parameters
    - test separate 1d fits instead of 2d
    - stage 3: only timeseries is normalized which causes scaling differences from the fits
- optimized stage 1 replotting/clicks (doesn't take a million years now woooo!!!!)
